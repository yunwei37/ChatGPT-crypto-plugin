# ChatGPT Crypto Standards and Encoding Plugin

This ChatGPT plugin brings together the most popular and widely used cryptographic standards and encoding methods. The plugin enhances ChatGPT's capabilities in handling various tasks requiring encryption, decryption, hashing, and encoding.

The plugin supports the following modules in order of most to least commonly used:

1. AES Encryption
2. HMAC-SHA256
3. SHA256
4. MD5
5. Hex Encoding
6. Base64 Encoding
7. UTF8 Encoding
8. PBKDF2
9. SHA1
10. HMAC-MD5

The integration of these modules with ChatGPT opens up a plethora of possibilities such as:

- Encrypting/Decrypting Messages: AES or other block ciphers can be used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information within conversations.
- Generating Signatures: Hashing algorithms like HMAC-SHA256 can be used to generate signatures for verifying the integrity and authenticity of messages.
- Password Storage: In scenarios where ChatGPT has to deal with user passwords, hashing functions like PBKDF2 can be used to hash passwords, thereby increasing security.
- Data Encoding and Decoding: If there's a need to handle binary data, encoding methods like Base64 can be used for encoding and decoding.

This plugin can also be combined with other plugins to provide more comprehensive functionality. For example, a file handling plugin can use hash functions to generate file hashes to check file integrity. Similarly, a network request plugin can use hash functions to generate request signatures for verifying request authenticity.

## Usage

To use this plugin, install it from the ChatGPT plugin store. Once installed, you can instruct ChatGPT to perform any of the supported cryptographic operations.

## Development

This plugin uses FastAPI as the backend server and the CryptoJS library for cryptographic operations. For more details, please refer to the source code.
